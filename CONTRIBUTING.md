At this point you're waiting on us. We intend to respond to PRs within a few business days,
but nobody pays us to do so. Please be patient.

We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Follow our style guide. Running the tests runs flake8, our style guide checker.
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
